Once you have a collection you can now add links to that collection by clicking the **"+"** button next to that collection's title (the current collection) or by clicking **+ LINK** on the extension's toolbar. By default, linkaTeca will fill out the title and link fields with the data of the current webpage you're. You can change those links manually to whatever title or links you want to save to your collection.
