# linkaTeca

This extension allows you to keep your links organized and available. It's different to browser bookmarks since you can organize your links into collections and subcollections.
Also, it allows you to take notes and use a friendly interface to edit the attributes of your links.

## Basic Usage

To create a collection just click **+ COLLECTION** on the extension's toolbar.
You'll see an edit window where you can set a title for the collection and an optional description.

Once you have a collection you can now add links to that collection by clicking the **"+"** button next to that collection's title (the current collection) or by clicking **+ LINK** on the extension's toolbar. By default, linkaTeca will fill out the title and link fields with the data of the current webpage you're. You can change those links manually to whatever title or links you want to save to your collection.

Collection can also have subcollections. A subcollection is nothing but a collection inside another collection. In other words, can form trees of collections or nest collections that are related to each other. You can add a subcollection by clicking the folder icon button next to that collection's title (second from left to right).

## Export Collections

You can export all your collections in JSON format. This is useful if you want to make a backup of your collections (see considerations). You can do this by clicking **"export"** from the toolbar menu (top left icon).

## Import Collections

You can also import collections in JSON format to linkaTeca. You can do this by clicking **"import"** from the toolbar menu (top left icon) and pasting your collections on the text area.

## Considerations

- All data of this extension is securely saved in the local storage of your machine using Chrome's API. Therefore, removing the extension of uninstalling/updating your browser might result in the loss of the data.

- As data is saved locally, no one but the person using your computer's browser has access to your collections data.
